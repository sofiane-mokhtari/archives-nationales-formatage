We felt the need to overcome the scan\u2014\ndalous discrepancies in the access to basic public goods\nby separate members ofthe l\u2018iuman family, resulting in new\nforms of violence. warfare and terrorism. A new effort is\nobviously called for to ii'nprove tlie quality of world\ngovernance. whicl\u2018i can be initiated bv a collective body of\nphilosophers, economists. sociologists and biologists,\nas well as of present and former lieads of Govemment wl'io\nhave shown a high degree of democratic efficiency and\ncommand respect.\n\nTlius constituted, the Collegium intends to take up\nspecific challenges and present recommendations or advice\non actions to be taken to improve world governance. Our\nappeal has already been signed by some seventy person\u2014\nalities from all parts of the world who share the conviction\nthat tlie Collegium can be an instrument of a new ambitions\nvision of the future. As you see, this is a \"soit power\", and\nnot a \"harcl powei\u201d, approacl\u2018i. The recommendations arrived\nat by the Collegium would not be binding for an body\u2014\nthey would iust remain recommendations.\n\nGlobalization i5 a fact. Whether it touches economics, the\nworld's financial regulations ortl'ie environment, it is non-\nsense to refuse globalization\u2014\u2014it is here t0 stay. But the\nproblem\u2019 lies in making it respond to tire basic needs and\nthe l'l urnan rights of the woi'ld's citizens. This will be one of\nthe main obiectives that the Collegium will pursue\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n1 UN GW\u0178\u00dcH .\n\nLuming global interdependence into an instrument for the\nwell-being of humanity, not for tl'ie dominance of tlie rich\nand the powerful.\n\n \n\n \n\nHow de you see the Coilegium working with the\nUnited Nations?\n\nThe Secretaw\u2014General will be the f irst and foremost. but not\nthe only recipient of the Collegium's recommendations\nor pronouncements. ln turn, the Collegium should be\ncapable of answering questions formulated by tl'ie United\nNations, sucl'i'as appropriate measures t0 restrain and\nreduce the AlDS epidemic, measures to control climatic\nchange, and point out emergencies in one or the other\narea. What, in fact, we do hope and expect is that the legit\u2014\nimacy and moral authority of the Collegium will prompt the\nSecretary\u2014General to request from us ad hoc recommandations.\n\nIn lune, Mr. Annan and l spoke about this initiative and\nhow he would consider it. He was very encouraging and shared\nour conviction, first expressed by President Kucan. that the\ncombination of statesmen and thinkers can be a trump card\nfor the clarification needed t0 promote a higher quali\u2018iy of\nworld governance.\n\n \n\nCollegium Members\u2014ali distinguished\u2014were seiected\nat an October meeting in Siovenia. What eise came\neut of that meeting?\n\nTl'ie main result was the drafting of a Declaration of\nlnterdependence. underlining the need to turn interde\u2014\npendence as a fact into interdependence as a goal to be\nachieved in the course of the century, namely an interde-\npendence of the rights and needs of all the inhabitants of\nour planet. Once it is formally accepted by all members of\ntl'ie Collegium, we intend t0 give the widest possible\npublicity to this Declaration, and this will take place on 26\nFebruary 2003 at UN Heaclquarters in New York. Later, on\n2 April. the Collegium will meet in Brussels at the European\n\n. Union Headquarters. and again on l lune in Geneva on the\n\noccasion of the next 6-8 Summit session in France.\n\n \n\nThat seems t0 be a very ambitious programme.\n\nAnd a badly needed one. We are not too optimistic on the\nprognosis of formal reforms at the United Nations. We\nthink that it will take time to attain more efficiency at the\nSecurity Council, less paralysis on account of vetoes,\nand a better authority for the Economic and Social Council.\nBut no time must be lost. Research is needed urgently, Before\nits results can be turned into mandates and formal insti-\ntutional decisions, a voice must be hearcl, drawing etliical\nauthority fromtlie unquestionable faith of all members of\nthe Collegium on the needed safeguard of our planet and\nof humankind.
