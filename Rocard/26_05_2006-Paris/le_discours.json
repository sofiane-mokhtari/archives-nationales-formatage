Franco American relations have been\nsometimes euphoric, and frequently dif\ufb01cult if not disastrous. We are not exactly in the best\n\nperiod, even if we have known much worse times three years ago.\n\nNaturally, being the American University in Paris, you know about all this much more than\nany other institution, and l am sure this experience passes from the collective body to all\nconcerned individuals. Delivering diplomas to French people is after all a very classical\nactivity of your institution, but you are very well aware that its meaning in France cannot be\n\nconsidered only private, or limited to Academic signi\ufb01cance.\n\nThere is in each one of our two countries a deep knowledge of the importance, and length, and\ndensity of our historical ties, as well as some annoyance, some irritation about the other.\n\nFrance shows evidently, every day, some sort of arrogance coming from her great past, from\nthe fact that she has led the world some four centuries ago, and that her language, culture and '\npatrimony \ufb01gure among the best of the world. Seen from an American point of view, by\n\ncitizens whose country lead effectively the world today and has an undisputed leadership as\n\n \n\nwell in technologies as in culture, this French self con\ufb01dence is by all means irritating. I do\nknow we should more discreetly and among ourselves exclusively cry on the loss of our\n\nformer empire ! The reference to Lafayette is now a threadbare argument.\n\nOn the reverse, America seen from France has something of an ungrateful child. The United\nStates uses little courtesy precautions to let us understand that our advices have no more any\nweight nor importance. Personally I do think this is quite natural, corresponds to the way\nthings are, and I don\u2019t mind. But most of my co-citizens don\u2019t take it that way and feel\noffended. Growing old is an art which is dif\ufb01cult to leam for individuals as well as for\nnations. A few of you, but unfortunately sometimes in govemment, make public that their\nmeasure of friendship is correlated with the enthusiasm we display in following your\ndecisions and opinions. I do admit this is a mistake in understanding what really is friendship,\nbut'I do admit as well that the balance of forces does not facilitate another attitude, and that\n\nwe should satisfy ourselves with a less demanding relation.\n\n \n\nThese dif\ufb01culties in mutual understanding are relatively recent. After Louis the XVIth\ndecision to go to war with Britain in order to help you conquering your independence, and the\nsignature in Paris in 1776 of the treaty which creates the international recognition of the\nUnited States of America, our relations have been absolutely without a cloud for a hundred\n\nand sixty years, a long period in human history. The deterioration is post world war II.\n\nIt might not be useless, on each side, t0 recall the main factors which have produced this\ndetrimental result. A better knowledge in each country of the element which has been most\n\ninj urious to the depth of our relations in the other might help to diminish the sorrow.\n\nSeen from the French side, the fact that in 1944, after having successfully landed, and freed\nour territory, the American government did not consider necessary to restore a country named\nFrance with independent authorities has been felt as an insult. For a short time we were no\nmore France, but AMGOT, American Military Govemment of Occupied Territories, with the\ndollar as currency. The banknotes were printed. This did not last long. Churchill immediately\nagreed with De Gaulle that this was not the good solution and made suf\ufb01cient pressure on\nRoosevelt to get rid of that issue. But symbolically the damage was done, and all the political\nelites of the liberated country harbored, for long, a deep resentment. Distrust and suspicion\n\nappeared in our relations.\n\n \n\nThe other way round, it is the nature and the origin of the so-called French anti\u2014Americanism\nwhich should be questioned. After the initial shock I just alluded to, the rancor remained\nlimited to the Gaullist circles. But we had another source of anti-American xenophobia. For\nour misfortune, France has inherited from the prewar and war periods a very powerful and\nvery Stalinist communist party. As soon as 1933 Maurice Thorez, his newly elected Secretary\nGeneral, decided to play an extremely nationalist card. And thanks to Nazi occupation the\ncommunist party succeeded in building, through a massive and courageous participation in the\nresistance, an extremely patriotic image which afterwards was used to serve a frantic anti-\nAmerican attitude. We know ourselves, we have polls, we study public opinion. The French\nanti-Americanism which comes from these two belongings rarely if ever exceeded 40 %\namong French citizens. But that was too much for American perception, after all the United\nStates had liberated us, we should be grateful. So, instead of a thorough analysis and a\nrecognition of majoritarian sympathy, we just got a global mistrust. Conditions are then\nfulfllled to produce when all this is outstripped by a real collective disagreement, for instance\nabout our Algerian war or yours in Iraq, a real and deep feeling of collective disapproval if\nnot rej ection. Such appreciations have generally proved themselves over estir/nated\u00efafterwards.\n\u201cl\"\"\u2018\u00efIor-A\\.,.\u2018t.\u201d\u2018l\nHaving chosen the American University in Paris, you belong to the highly se e efi category\nof witnesses of the Franco American friendship. So do I by a long conviction and today\u2019s\ndistinction. This creates for us the duty to analyze any punctual disagreement, to get it rid of\nsubjective and historically dated fantasies, and \ufb01nally to make on any occasion the difference\nbetween opinions on political decisions and the reality of a deeply rooted ancient and\npermanent relation of solidarity, friendship and of common destiny as founding democracies.\nThis should even be compatible with an improvement of our mutual listening capacities. After\nall our two countries are rich of an enormous experience, different for each, but which\n\nprobably deserves to be presented to the other and examined, in mutual interest.\n\nI insist on this necessity to rid our relation from temporary political pollutions because I am\nworried. The evolution of our respective cultural models is diverging. The enormous power of\nthe United States is disproportionate to its short history. Some of your goveming authorities\nseem to take pleasure in using force, whereas military power should always be used with self\n\nrestriction and modesty.\n\n \n\nOn our side, the extreme weakness is no better advisor.\n\nAnd, which is more, our basic social attitudes, our anthropological cultures, as sociologists\nwould say, are not converging either. Concerning the use of natural resources, or the accepted\ndegree of social cruelty that market economy implies, we behave differently, and apparently\nmore and more differently. My friend Jeremy Ri\ufb02<in has recently published a fascinating\nbook, called \u201cThe European dream\u201d, which enlightens all that. To preserve our relation the\n\nminimum is to take \ufb01ill conscience of these evolutions and understand them.\n\nAll of you, newly graduated members of the American University in Paris, have had the\nchance of discovering and experimenting the two cultures of our countries. Therefore, you\nhave now a signi\ufb01cant role to play in order to facilitate comprehension, increase mutual\n\nknowledge, and develop con\ufb01dent relations between the United States and France.\n\nIn front of the fast growing Asia, of the awakening of Russia, all regions with which mutual\nunderstanding is not established in advance, I do think there is an absolute necessity of\nsolidarity between western democratic nations. It cannot result only of political opportunity or\neven necessity. It has to rely on mutual respect, knowledge and con\ufb01dence, all commodities\n\nthat can be provided by a good old rusty but faithful friendship.\n\n/_ (\u2018 . \u201d\\\n\\. :4:\np. . .123\n4 . ,\n\u00ab145:.
