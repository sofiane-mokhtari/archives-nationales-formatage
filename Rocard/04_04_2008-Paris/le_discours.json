Evidently that the markets are legitimate and respected\nwhen they aim at diminishing Mhuman pain, or at least at keeping it stable, but they areEio\nmore legitimatawhen they aim at aggravating it. I cannot forget here that the founders of\nmodem economics were all moralists, such as Adam Smith, David Ricardo and the French\nDoctor Fran\u00e7ois Quesnay. Them comes the second question : if one admits that markets\nshould respect ethical principles not only for reasons of morality and dignity, but also for\nreasons of ef\ufb01ciency, and if one admits too that an excessive percentage of human beings are\nnot ready to respect ethics in their conduct, in the banking profession as in any other, should\nwe then admit that precise rules and sanctions are necessary in place of declaration of\nprinciples and codes of conduct ?\n\nA second aspect of the present crisis aggravates the importance of this question. When\nmany banks developing mortgage loans discovered that they had in portfolio an important\nvolume of doubtful papers, instead of transmitting the news to regulating authorities and\nmaking provisions the face the loss, they attempted to hide it. They did so by mixing the\nmortgage loans certi\ufb01cates with more reliable \ufb01nancial papers in \u201cpackages\u201d which they sold\n\nthroughout the world. This is the reason \u00e0r\u2014Wh-ieh so many banks in the United States, in\nEurope, in Japan, and in a few others countriebswnfeet heavy dif\ufb01culties today. We all know\nthat the three main American banks are in trouble, we\u2019ve all heard of Northern Rock, two\nimportant banks in Germany are concerned as well, and the last news quote UBS, one of the\nlargest Swiss banks. In this issue, in some way second stop issue, it is again a violation of\nethical principles which is the cause of \ufb01nancial disequilibrium. The missing capital here is\nevaluated between 400 and 1.000 billions of dollars. But the main result of this diffusion of\nthe risks is that no bank, presently, seems capable to evaluate the risk to which its usual\npartners are exposed. Banks now do not lend anymore in current days economics, and this is\nthe way the threat of recession progresses.\n\ngi\ufb02e\n\u201d3m\n\nL\u00ce \\\n. \\\\\n\nl\n\nDo we really think that the recall of basic ethical principles will be suf\ufb01cient to solvw\n\nall that ? I personally don\u2019t, and that is why my third impression is about rules.\n\nThird impression, then : we need rules. In our present legal system, the only bodies\nwhich have at the same time the legitimacy and the legal capacity to pronounce rules, and\nespecially constraining rules including sanctions, are\u00ffq\u2019national governments. Unfortunately\nthey are not the pertinent entity. Capital circulates with no limits in the whole planet except\nNorth Korea, Cuba, and for a decreasing part China. No structure, neither the United Nations\nOrganisation nor the International Monetary Fund, has any capacity to enforce norms. At the\nworld level, the only way to decide prescriptions and sanctions are international treaties. In\nterms of law the recommendations of the Bretton-Woods international \ufb01nancial conference in\n1945 took the form of a treaty.\n\nI propose to the gathered wisdoms of this respectable college that this is now what we\nneed. I suppose, for instance that nearly all of us support the courageous efforts of Henry\nPaulson the American Secretary for the Treasury. He has to win, and may. But his attempts\nare limited to the United States, and cannot concern all the subjects which need to be treated.\nThe more I think of it, the less I can avoid the idea of convening a world \ufb01nancial conference,\na Bretton-Woods two sort of thing. It could decide for new international rules for certain\nitems, and press all governments to decide in the \ufb01eld of their competences for others.\n\nIn a miscellaneous order, without any logical priority, I think the following eight\nsubj ects should be prepared, and dealt with.\n\n \n\n- Rules and procedures to be followed for mortgage loans.\n\n\u2014 Rede\ufb01nition and e tension of the security ratios, prudential ratios, as we say in \u00d9\nfrenc\u00eb\u00ebuch as th 0k rati nd their successors, which should be imposed to \u0152\n\nall op ators on the marketsms naturally, but also funds and brokers.\n\n\u2014 To rules of agreement and international taxation on tax havens .\n\n- To'enforce a world-wide separation of banking activities, in the spirit of the former\nGlass-Steagall Act.\n\n\u2014 To create some world wide instruments to measure the evolution of the prices of\nassets and real estates as it is done for consumption goods and services.\n\n- To de\ufb01ne strictly and limitate the possibility t0 create new \ufb01nancial products, in\nfact derivative products, and submit them to the control of regulating authorities.\n\n- To allow Central Banks to discount or acquire je public bonds \ufb01nancing\n\n \n  \n \n \n\ninvestment. 1m . \\\n\u2014 To come back t0 a system of \ufb01xed adjustable exchang tes. \u2019 \\\n\nKM,\n\u201cluge\n\nAnd this list is naturally not exhaustive.\n\nI cannot \ufb01nish this intervention without confessing a great worry, which is my fourth\nimpression.\n\nOutside the \ufb01nancial crisis we live in, and in the pure \ufb01eld of real econo y feeling \u00ae\nis that the \ufb01nancial crisis happens in a period in which real economy is weakene .
